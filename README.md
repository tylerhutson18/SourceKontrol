# SourceKontrol

This is a project to try to incorporate source control in a Digital Audio Workstation through a VST plug-in interface for simplified collaboration.


## Get Started

To get started with this plug-in, you will need to set up a GitHub repository for your project. 
(If you are unfamiliar with this process, look [here](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).)

Upon opening the plug-in, your current directory should be displayed. This is where your project is located, and should be your repo location. 

Go ahead and record some audio, click commit, then push, and observe your repo online to verify your files got pushed.
